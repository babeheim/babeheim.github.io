      <description>Missing data is probably the most under-trained topic in data analysis. Methods courses prepare students for performing all kinds of robustness checks on data they have, but what to do when some of your data is missing is relegated as special topics, or left for higher-level courses.
This is a mistake, I think, because missingness is a ubiquitous problem, as are ad hoc solutions like the following entirely hypothetical methods section:</description>

      <title>Text Mining the Human Behavioral Ecology Bibliography</title>

      <description>Thanks to Kermyt Anderson, the Human Behavioral Ecology Bibliography (HBEB) has recently gone online. Eleanor Power has taken this text file and parsed it into a bibtex file, and from there it can be turned into an Endnote library or other bibliographic database format.
After a long hiatus, the Human Behavioral Ecology Bibliography is back online, now as an editable google doc. #HBEBhttps://t.co/tpVPE5jHQf
&amp;mdash; Kermyt Anderson (@KermytAnderson) June 13, 2017  BibTex version of the HBE Bibliography is done and available for you to use and augment!</description>

      <description>A colleague doing a social network analysis posed the following problem:1
 In my field interviews, I had people name friends they could go to for support. Most friends are the same ethnicity as my interviewees, but some are members of nearby minority groups. I&amp;rsquo;m trying to see if the women at my field site have a lesser/greater percent of friends from other ethnic groups than men. I was wondering if there&amp;rsquo;s some way to do this in STAN in R, or some other way that you might know of how to deal with this&amp;hellip;</description>

      <title>Capturing Hierarchical Data in Plain Text</title>

      <description>A practical method of entering structured data into a computer is to type it directly into a text file. Simply fire up your favorite CSV editor1, sit down with your source material and start typing. Unlike boutique database software, this method can be used immediately and with minimal training. In fact, I know several researchers who skip paper forms altogether and do it during their field interviews.
Plaintext data entry works great, unless the data are hierarchical.</description>

      <description>the following article was adapted for the Evolutionary Anthropology Society newsletter for Summer 2016
The last decade has been a sobering one for science, marked by increasingly frank conversations about &amp;lsquo;the idea that something has gone fundamentally wrong with one of our greatest human creations&amp;rsquo;, to quote Richard Horton, editor-in-chief of The Lancet. He continues,
 Afflicted by studies with small sample sizes, tiny effects, invalid exploratory analyses, and flagrant conflicts of interest, together with an obsession for pursuing fashionable trends of dubious importance, science has taken a turn towards darkness.</description>
