      <title>Fitting Markov Models to Tetris Data in Stan</title>

      <description>In my last post, I simulated millions draws from two versions of the piece randomizer inside Tetris. The 1989 algorithm for NES Tetris can be described as a first-order Markov process, biased against repeat pieces, while the Gameboy algorithm is a more complex, second-order process with some seriously strange biases. At least, that&amp;rsquo;s what the simulation says. Here we use real Tetris data to find out if these simulation models are accurate, using the Stan language to fit simple multistate Markov models.</description>

      <title>Is Tetris Biased?</title>

      <description>My first experience with stochastic processes was in 1989, with Tetris on the Nintendo Gameboy. Each of the seven Tetris pieces arrived one at a time, chosen by some mysterious intelligence who seemed to know exactly which pieces I didn&amp;rsquo;t want. In the early 1990s, I had no way to tell how this process worked, or confirm whether it really was biased in some way, but with modern tools - primarily the R programming language - and plenty of free resources online, this is a straightforwards exercise.</description>

      <title>Missing data, moralizing gods, and the siren song of Aeiea</title>

      <description>Missing data is probably the most under-trained topic in data analysis. Methods courses prepare students for performing all kinds of robustness checks on data they have, but what to do when some of your data is missing is relegated as special topics, or left for higher-level courses.
This is a mistake, I think, because missingness is a ubiquitous problem, as are ad hoc solutions like the following entirely hypothetical methods section:</description>

      <title>Text Mining the Human Behavioral Ecology Bibliography</title>

      <description>Thanks to Kermyt Anderson, the Human Behavioral Ecology Bibliography (HBEB) has recently gone online. Eleanor Power has taken this text file and parsed it into a bibtex file, and from there it can be turned into an Endnote library or other bibliographic database format.

I&amp;rsquo;m curious to know more about HBEB&amp;rsquo;s use as a dataset in its own right, and since I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing similar work with our field data here at MPI-EVA&amp;rsquo;s new Department of Human Behavior, Ecology and Culture, I figured I could turn the lens on us at the same time as showcase the methods to interested parties.</description>

      <title>Generating Ties to Explore Social Network Connectivity</title>

      <description>A colleague doing a social network analysis posed the following problem:1
 In my field interviews, I had people name friends they could go to for support. Most friends are the same ethnicity as my interviewees, but some are members of nearby minority groups. I&amp;rsquo;m trying to see if the women at my field site have a lesser/greater percent of friends from other ethnic groups than men. I was wondering if there&amp;rsquo;s some way to do this in STAN in R, or some other way that you might know of how to deal with this&amp;hellip;</description>

      <title>Capturing Hierarchical Data in Plain Text</title>

      <description>A practical method of entering structured data into a computer is to type it directly into a text file. Simply fire up your favorite CSV editor1, sit down with your source material and start typing. Unlike boutique database software, this method can be used immediately and with minimal training. In fact, I know several researchers who skip paper forms altogether and do it during their field interviews.
Plaintext data entry works great, unless the data are hierarchical.</description>

      <title>Reproducible Research As Our New Default</title>

      <description>the following article was adapted for the Evolutionary Anthropology Society newsletter for Summer 2016
The last decade has been a sobering one for science, marked by increasingly frank conversations about &amp;lsquo;the idea that something has gone fundamentally wrong with one of our greatest human creations&amp;rsquo;, to quote Richard Horton, editor-in-chief of The Lancet. He continues,
 Afflicted by studies with small sample sizes, tiny effects, invalid exploratory analyses, and flagrant conflicts of interest, together with an obsession for pursuing fashionable trends of dubious importance, science has taken a turn towards darkness.</description>
