<p>A classic theory in evolutionary social science argues that cooperation is generally promoted by high within-group similarity. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._D._Hamilton">W. D. Hamilton</a> himself contributed to this literature in 1975<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, following up on his famous rule for the evolution of altruism among kin. For a population of individuals clustered into groups playing a <a href="">Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilemma</a> (or something like it), Hamilton showed that cooperation can evolve when</p>
<p>$$
F_{ST} &gt; \frac{c}{b}\tag{1}
$$</p>
<p>where parameter $b$ is the benefits, and $c$ the costs, of cooperation. Within-group similarity is tracked by the $F_{ST}$ index, which measures how much (from zero to one) of a population&rsquo;s variation on some measure lies between, rather than within, groups.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>One way to interpret this theoretical result: <em>segregation works</em>. In Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilemma-like interactions, groups that have the ability to discriminate against or exclude non-cooperators do better, and the cooperative individuals within them achieve higher payoffs. In real group-structured interactions resembling a Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilemma, higher $F_{ST}$&rsquo;s should be associated with group-beneficial traits such as increased within-group cooperativeness and between-group xenophobia and warfare. Further, when two groups have very similar behavioral, cultural, or genetic markers, the pairwise $F_{ST}$ between those two groups will be very small, while very different groups will have a high $F_{ST}$ score<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. Such cultural $F_{ST}$ scores can potentially serve as a benchmark for how similar (or how coheasive) two cultures will be. All this work, though, is really just based on the Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilemma as the model of social interaction. What happens when we change the game?</p>
<p>My coauthor Adrian Bell and I answer this question in <a href="">a newly-published piece</a> in <em>Evolutionary Human Sciences</em>. Following Hamilton, we ask how $F_{ST}$ works when we allow interactions to be <em>frequency-dependent</em>. In these games, no strategy is dominant, and the best response always depends on what other players will do. Familiar games in this category include the Stag Hunt, Snowdrift, the Hawk-Dove game, and Chicken.</p>
<p>In the <a href="">Hawk-Dove game</a>, for example, a group of Doves can be invaded by Hawk, but the reverse is also true: too much fighting between Hawks means that Doves can invade a group of Hawks, leading to a stable, high-diversity mixed equilibrium.</p>
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, in all such games, the role of $F_{ST}$ is more complex. Mathematically, we can show that group-beneficial behaviors<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> now evolve according to the inequality</p>
<p>$$
F_{ST} &gt; \frac{c - d\overline{x}}{b + d(1-\overline{x})}\tag{2}
$$</p>
<p>where $d$ is Queller&rsquo;s &lsquo;synergy coefficient&rsquo;, representing the extent to which social interactions are more than the sum of their parts<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. That is, if $b$ is the benefit from pairing up with a cooperator, the interaction of <em>two</em> cooperators leads to the synergistic payoff $b + d$ for each of them.</p>
<p>One way to represent the role of $F_{ST}$ in selection for group-beneficial outcomes is with an <em>evolutionary phase diagram</em>, which shows the strength and direction of selection at any given population state. In a Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilemma, the phase diagram for the evolution of cooperation looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/pd_phase_diagram.png" alt=""></p>
<p>If $F_{ST}$ is below Hamilton&rsquo;s threshold $c/b$, the force of selection is against cooperation. If there is enough within-group similarity, though, selection reverses and cooperation will become common.</p>
<p>When synergy is added, the frequencies of each behavior interact with $F_{ST}$ according to Equation 2. Consider the phase diagram for the Hawk-Dove game:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/hd_phase_diagram.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Like in the PD, higher $F_{ST}$&rsquo;s are generally good for evolving peaceful Dove behaviors &mdash; Doves generally are able to keep Hawks out of their groups, and Hawks become concentrated in quarrelsome, low-payoff groups. But there&rsquo;s a twist: Equation 2 shows that frequency-dependent interactions, $F_{ST}$ are no longer directly comparable between populations; even though the population located at $Y$ in the Hawk-Dove phase diagram has a higher $F_{ST}$ than one at $X$, it has <em>weaker</em> selection for Doves.</p>
<p>The role of $F_{ST}$ as a segregation index changes even more dramatically the further you go from a Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilemma. In certain classes of interaction, higher group segregation (higher $F_{ST}$) will be <em>actively harmful</em> to evolving optimal behaviors. Consider the complementarity game, Invisible Hand. Here players must choose between two complementary activities, e.g. to produce food, or write books. Both are valuable, but the best outcome is for each individual to specialize in one behavior and pair up specialists in the other behavior. However, if $F_{ST}$ is high, groups will often be made up of one, or the other, behavior. Plugging this game into Eq. 2, we get an even more interesting phase diagram:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/ih_phase_diagram.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In Invisible Hand, greater segregation keeps complementary behaviors from invading mostly-homogenous groups, preventing the group from reaching the highest possible payoffs. Imagine an overly-protectionistic market that keeps out delicious new foods, where the fear of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taco_trucks_on_every_corner">taco truck on every corner</a> makes everyone worse off.</p>
<p>We also find this surprising reversal in Pure Coordination games, in which groups are trying to settle on one of two essentially-identical alternatives, with high costs for a group that fails to coordinate on the same behavior. A classic example is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-_and_right-hand_traffic">driving on the left or the right side of the road</a>. In such games, the phase diagram looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/pc_phase_diagram.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Selection always favors &ldquo;Right&rdquo; if it is above the frequency $k$ (this is determined by the specific payoffs of each game), and always favors &ldquo;Left&rdquo; if it is below $k$. The more popular convention tends to stabilize over time. However, suprisingly, $F_{ST}$ also slows convergence towards global solution. This is because a higher $F_{ST}$ also means that groups will have a harder time shifting away from unpopular or inefficient ways of doing things. We could call this the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagen_H">H-day problem</a>, after the enormous efforts Sweden untook in 1967 to switch their road system to use the same side as all of their neighbors.</p>
<p>We think this is a pretty exciting addition to the theory. Under some frequency-dependent circumstances, the basic logic for low diversity promoting group-beneficial outcomes holds. But when behaviors are complementary with each other, or the task is one of simple coordination, between-group segregation can be actively harmful to evolving good solutions.</p>
